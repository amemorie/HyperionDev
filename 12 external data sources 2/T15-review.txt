Excellent work with this submission Angela. Your solution is exceptionally well done and you have done a great job of extending your program to incorporate additional functionality. You have demonstrated a clear understanding of writing to text files and working with external data sources. Your work with regex is awesome and you've done well to add some defensive programming to your work. Your docstrings are terrific too, well done!

Good stuff, Angela. You really nailed this task.

This is an impressive bit of code. You have made excellent use of defensive programming. You are using docstrings effectively to document the code. The code makes excellent use of functions. The functions are well constructed and use type hinting well. The function names are descriptive and make the flow of your code easy to understand. Your variable names are descriptive and help to understand your code.

The file handling for both the reading and writing operations is excellent with defensive programming.

Excellent submission overall, Angela. Keep it up!

You've shown a deep understanding of Classes and OOP.
The code makes excellent use of defensive programming using both input validation and exception handling.
The class definition is well-written and the methods are well-constructed.
It's great to see you using docstrings to document your functions. Your comments will help this code to be understandable and maintainable.

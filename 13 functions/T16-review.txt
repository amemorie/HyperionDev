Great stuff, Angela, keep up the good work!

The code makes excellent use of docstrings to document the code.
Nice use of type-hinting when declaring the variables and passing parameters in function calls. You have used data structures like the flight_options dictionary well to develop a good solution.

This is an exceptionally well-written program. You are using best practices for input validation and exception handling. The functions are well-named, commented and styled. The code matches pep8 standard styling. The UI is informative and intuitive, making it easy to use.
Your solution is exceptionally well done and you have done a great job of extending your program to incorporate additional functionality.


The program is exceptional, but with so many functions and a relatively long file length of over 600 lines, It would be a good idea to break the code up into multiple files, which would allow you to reuse some of the excellent input validation code in other projects.

This was awesome, Angela. You really nailed this task.
I'm looking forward to the next submission!
